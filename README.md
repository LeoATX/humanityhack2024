# Fist Bump
> High five your boredom goodbye with our campus event calendar, connecting you to the coolest happenings near you.

## Inspiration
Did you ever struggle to find exciting events happening on campus and feel isolated or bored? Clubs and events at Santa Clara University lack an easily accessible central resource for students. We want to connect students to campus events that enriched their college experience, everyday.

## What it does
This is an accesible website for students to discover what events are available on campus from their selected time frame. We have also made it easy for club leaders to add events.

## How we built it
### front end
We used a Vue.js JavaScript framework â€” this is allowed us to quickly develop and deliver within the tight time frame of a hackathon, while maintaining top notch performance and quality.

### back end
Our back end server consisted of a dart-shelf server querying into a HiveDB. In short, this allows an ultra-lightweight backend server with lightinging fast key-value accessing, all while being encrypted to the highest industry standard.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are confident to make the claim that we are the only team that has used a dart-shelf servered backend. This is a truly unique approach to deploying a backend server. We are able to achieve blazing fast respond times, handle heavy traffic with ease, and have a future proof architecture.

## Challenges we ran into
With just four people on our team, we struggled in keeping up with our development schedule. Our team's limited experience with Vue.js meant that we had a lot to learn on the way.

## What's next for Fist Bump
- authentication: club events are only added by student leaders
- management: easily add or change events in case plans change
- calendar: integrate with Google Calendar or similar to curate events to students' schedule
